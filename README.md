# Subdomain Scanner

This is a simple Python script that allows you to scan for subdomains of a target domain using a user-provided wordlist.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the `subdomain-scanner.py` script.

3. Create a wordlist file with a list of subdomains you want to check, each on a new line. For example, create a file named `wordlist.txt` and add your subdomains.

4. Run the script by opening a terminal and navigating to the directory containing the `subdomain-scanner.py` script. Then execute the following command:

python subdomain-scanner.py


5. Follow the prompts to enter the target domain and the path to your wordlist file.

6. The script will scan each subdomain from the wordlist and check if it resolves to an IP address for the target domain. If a subdomain is found, it will be displayed.

## Important Notes

- **Legal and Ethical Use:** Ensure that you have proper authorization before scanning any domain. Unauthorized scanning can be considered unethical and may have legal implications.
